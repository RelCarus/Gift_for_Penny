					Once upon a time, there was a young man named Rel, born into a simple yet loving family.
					But as the years passed, his father grew distant—his once warm presence turning cold and, at times, cruel.
					Rel had to learn most things on his own.
					His parents never truly supported him, whether in his hobbies or his education.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Despite this, he carried on.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					In kindergarten, he was surrounded by kind teachers and cheerful friends, making it a time of warmth and laughter.
					But everything changed when he entered elementary school.
					The world that once seemed bright became harsh.
					Some classmates and even teachers treated him with cruelty.
					When he showed kindness, they saw it as weakness—using him as a scapegoat, a tool for their own benefit.
					He made a few friends, but trust was a luxury he couldn't afford.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Time passed, and in his fifth year, an English competition was announced.
					For the first time in a while, he felt excitement.
					He rushed home, eager to ask his father to let him participate.
					But his father dismissed the idea, telling him it wasn't important.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Days later, the competition took place.
					One of his classmates, who had been allowed to join, won first place.
					As the news spread, Rel felt a heavy disappointment settle in his chest—not just in himself, but in his father.
					His classmates, rather than sympathizing, mocked him for not even trying.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					He wanted to believe things would get better.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					But deep down, he wasn't sure anymore.
