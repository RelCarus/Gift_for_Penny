				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Years passed, and Rel entered junior high school.
					He tried his best to leave the past behind—to forget the weight of old wounds and start anew.
					The environment was better than elementary school; his classmates were more mature, and he managed to make a few friends.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					But something inside him had changed.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Once, he had been the top-ranked student.
					Now, his name appeared somewhere between tenth and fifteenth place.
					The fire that once fueled his dreams had dimmed, flickering unsteadily.
					Though he still studied, it no longer felt the same.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					More years passed.
					Now, he was in senior high school.
					With renewed excitement, he set his sights on his goal—to become a game programmer.
					His passion reignited, and his progress was remarkable.
					He aced every subject except Japanese and history, subjects he struggled with because of his tendency to forget things easily.
					Even so, he pressed on.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					But once again, his parents didn't truly support him.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					In his second year, he applied for an apprenticeship, hoping to gain valuable work experience.
					He had expected challenges, but nothing could have prepared him for the toll it would take on his mental health.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					The workplace was suffocating.
					Conversations with coworkers felt like battles, each word draining his energy.
					Tasks were sparse, leaving him trapped in a cycle of boredom and burnout.
					Day after day, the monotony chipped away at him.
					His mind, once sharp and full of ambition, dulled.
					His skills declined.
					His memory worsened.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					By the time he entered his final year—six months away from graduation—he was lost.
					The uncertainty of the future weighed heavily on him.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					"I don't know what to do anymore."
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					"I have no goal. No direction. Does my life even matter if I'm just being used by others?"
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					The thoughts turned darker.
					For the first time, he considered giving up entirely.
					The idea of disappearing lingered in his mind.
					But then, another thought followed.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					"Would anyone miss me?"
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					The answer was yes.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					He realized that even if it didn't feel like it, there were people who cared.
					People who would be hurt if he were gone.
					With that thought, he tried to distract himself—scrolling through TikTok, watching funny videos, seeking something, anything, to pull him away from the abyss.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					And so, he searched for connection.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					For hope.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					For a reason to keep going.
