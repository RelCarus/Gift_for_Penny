					The new year of 2025 had arrived, but to Rel, it was just another number on the calendar. He had spent the past months trying to distract himselfâ€”commenting on random videos, searching for people to talk to, hoping to find a connection.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					But most of them weren't what he was looking for. Some were indifferent, some were strange, and others just didn't seem like the kind of people he could truly call friends.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Then came January 26th.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					That day, something different happened. A message notification popped up on his screen. Someone had reached out to him first. His heart raced with excitementâ€”it was rare for someone to approach him.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Her name was Penelope, but he quickly started calling her Penny.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Their first conversation was casual, just two strangers exchanging words. But as they talked more, something clicked. They shared their favorite thingsâ€”music, books, food, and even school subjects. But the most important thing?
				</p>
				<p class="fw-bold text-start text-break">
					CATS.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					That alone was enough to make him feel like they were meant to be friends.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					But there was something about Penny that truly fascinated himâ€”she loved to write. It was a rare passion in a world where people rarely took the time to put their thoughts into words. And the way she spoke about it, the way she expressed herselfâ€”it was beautiful. It was inspiring.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					As days passed and their conversations deepened, Rel began to see something he hadn't noticed before. For the first time in a long while, he felt like he had met someone who truly understood him.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Penny was kindâ€”genuinely kind, not the kind of kindness that expected something in return. She listened. She cared. And through her words, she made him realize something he had been too afraid to face.
				</p>
				<p class="fw-bold text-start text-break">
					He needed to forgive himself.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					She never told him directlyâ€”never forced him to change. But simply by being there, by talking to him, by believing in him, she showed him that he wasn't as broken as he thought.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					He could let go of the past.
					He could start again.
					He could be betterâ€”not just for others, but for himself.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					And for that, he was endlessly grateful.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Because Penny reminded him of who he used to be.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					And more importantly, she helped him become who he wanted to be.

					Penny,
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					From the day we first talked, you became a light in my life that I never expected but desperately needed. You showed me kindness when I struggled to be kind to myself, you reminded me of the beauty in small moments, and most of all, you made me feel like I wasn't alone.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					I never believed in fate or destiny, but meeting youâ€”finding someone who understands me in ways I never thought possibleâ€”has made me wonder if maybe, just maybe, the universe led me to you for a reason.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					So here I am, writing this with every ounce of honesty in my heart: I like you, Penny. I like you for your kindness, your passion, your words, your laughterâ€”everything that makes you, you. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that if given the chance, I would love to be a part of your story, just as you've become such an important part of mine.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					No matter what your answer is, I just want to say thank you. For being you. For being here. For everything.
				</p>
				<p class="text-start text-break">
					Happy Valentine's Day, Penny. ðŸ§¡
